### hey 👋


I'm currently working on:

*  a [quantum cryptography demonstration 🔐](https://github.com/bmedicke/quantum_cryptography) with an [optical cavity ✨](https://github.com/bmedicke/optical-cavity)
*  and a [TUI pomodoro timer written in Go ⌛](https://github.com/bmedicke/pom)
<!-- *  and my [portfolio 🎨](http://benmedicke.com) -->
